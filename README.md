# Knit_Companion
# A simple (beginner-made) application in Python to provide some simple support for Knitting Hobbyists.
#
#The need:
#  The request made to me was to have an application that could track progress of a knitting pattern as it is being completed.
#  Work flow will be Num of Stitches (sts), Num of Rows, and Num of Repeats. Currently not intended to be a Stitch-counter, only
#  rows and repeats at this time.
#
#The planned outcome of this application (by final release) will have the following points/features:
#*Keyboard input for ROW counting
#*Display current Row and Repeat on screen
#*Added save function for variables (and to load progress from .txt)
#*Added support for increased rows as repeats progress, linear increases and non-linear (possibly by adding "phases" of pattern)
#*Improved GUI, pending user feedback
#*Added pattern input support, to display the Stitched required on current Row (but this could very labor intensive)
#
#As I become more experienced in Python and other programming languages, this application may expand in features that I have not considered yet. I will edit this README as the releases progress and features are added.
#I appreciate any input on this project, I invite anyone to communicate with me via GitHub!
#
#CHANGELOGS;
#GUI Build:
#v0.01a - Alpha, first build. Working through some hiccups of connecting the variables to the entry widgets and functions. (Non-Operational)
#
#CMD Build:
#v0.1b - Beta, I was aiming for a barebones and functional script to accomplish the core function. This was my first success of the project.
